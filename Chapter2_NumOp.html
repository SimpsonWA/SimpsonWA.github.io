    <h1>Unconstrained Optimization</h1>
    <p>Minimize objective function with no restrictions on the value of variables formulated as:</p>
    <div>
    

\[
    \min_{x} f(x)
    \]


    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>\( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \): real vector with \( n \geq 1 \) components</li>
        <li>\( f: \mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R} \)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.1 What is the solution</h2>
    <p><strong>Global minimizer</strong> of \( f \):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a point \( x^{*} \) is a global minimizer if \( f(x^{*}) \leq f(x) \) for all \( x \)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Local Minimizer (weak) of \( f \):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A point \( x^{*} \) is a local minimizer if there is a neighborhood \( \mathcal{N} \) of \( x^{*} \) such that \( f(x^{*}) \leq f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathcal{N} \)</li>
        <li>\( \mathcal{N} \) or neighborhood of \( x^{*} \) is just an open set that contains \( x^{*} \)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>(Strict) Local Minimizer of \( f \):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A point \( x^{*} \) is a strict local minimizer if there is a neighborhood \( \mathcal{N} \) of \( x^{*} \) such that \( f(x^{*}) < f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathcal{N} \) with \( x \neq x^{*} \)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>(Isolated) Local Minimizer of \( f \):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A point \( x^{*} \) is an isolated local minimizer if there is a neighborhood \( \mathcal{N} \) of \( x^{*} \) such that \( x^{*} \) is the only local minimizer in \( \mathcal{N} \)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recognizing a local minimum</h3>
    <p>When \( f \) is smooth (\( f \) is twice differentiable) we can tell that \( x^{*} \) is a local minimizer (and possibly strict) by examining the gradient \( \nabla f(x^{*}) \) and the Hessian \( \nabla^{2}f(x^{*}) \)</p>

    <h4>Theorem 2.1: <em>Taylor's Theorem</em></h4>
    <p>Suppose that \( f: \mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is continuously differentiable and that \( p \in \mathbb{R}^n \) then we would have:</p>
    <div>
    

\[
    f(x+p) = f(x) + \nabla f(x+tp)^{T}p 
    \]


    </div>
    <p>for some \( t \in (0,1) \). Moreover if \( f \) is twice continuously differentiable we have that:</p>
    <div>
    

\[
    \nabla f(x+p) = \nabla f(x) \int_{0}^{1} \nabla^{2}f(x+tp)p \, dt
    \]


    </div>
    <p>and that:</p>
    <div>
    

\[
    f(x+p) = f(x) + \nabla f(x)^{T}p + \frac{1}{2}p^{T}\nabla^{2}f(x+tp)p
    \]


    </div>
    <p>for some \( t \in (0,1) \)</p>

    <h4>Theorem 2.2: <em>First order necessary Conditions</em></h4>
    <p>If \( x^{*} \) is a local minimizer and \( f \) is continuously differentiable in an open neighborhood of \( x^{*} \) then \( \nabla f(x^{*}) =0 \)</p>

    <h4>Theorem 2.3: <em>Second Order Necessary Conditions</em></h4>
    <p>If \( x^{*} \) is a local minimizer of \( f \) and \( \nabla^{2}f \) exists and is continuous in an open neighborhood of \( x^{*} \) then \( \nabla f(x^{*}) =0 \) and \( \nabla^{2}f(x^{*}) \) is positive semidefinite</p>

    <h4>Theorem 2.4: <em>Second order sufficient conditions</em></h4>
    <p>Suppose that \( \nabla^{2}f \) is continuous in an open neighborhood of \( x^{*} \) and that \( \nabla f(x^{*}) =0 \) and  \( \nabla^{2}f(x^{*}) \) is positive semidefinite. Then \( x^{*} \) is a strict local minimizer of \( f \)</p>

    <h4>Theorem 2.5</h4>
    <p>When \( f \) is convex any local minimizer \( x^{*} \) is a global minimizer of \( f \). Also if \( f \) is differentiable, then any stationary point \( x^{*} \) is a global minimizer of \( f \)</p>

    <h2>2.2 Overview of Algorithms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Commonly user selects starting point \( x_{0} \)</li>
        <li>Beginning at \( x_{0} \) the algorithm generates a sequence of iterations \( \{x_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty} \) that terminates either when no progress is made or sufficiently reached a solution</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2 Strategies: Line search and Trust region</h3>
    <p><strong>Line Search</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Algorithm chooses a direction \( p_{k} \) and searches along this direction from the current iteration \( x_{k} \) for a new iteration with a lower value</li>
        <li>Distance along \( p_{k} \) can be found by solving the following minimization problem to find a step length \( \alpha \):
        
\[
        \min_{\alpha > 0 } f(x_{k}+ \alpha p_{k})
        \]


        </li>
        <li>The line search algorithm generates a limited number of trial step lengths until it finds one that loosely approximates the equation above. At the new point, a new search direction and step length are committed and the process iterates.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Trust Region</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Info about \( f \) is gathered to construct \( m_{k} \) (model function) whose behavior near \( x_{k} \) is similar to that of \( f \)</li>
        <li>We restrict the search for \( m_k \) to some region near \( x_{k} \), in other words, candidate step \( p \) by approximating:
        

\[
        \min_{p}m_{k}(x_{k}+p)
        \]


        </li>
        <li>Where \( x_{k}+p \) lies inside the trust region</li>
        <li>If the candidate solution does not provide a sufficient increase in \( f \), we can conclude the trust region is too large</li>
    </ul>
