    <h1>Sum rule and Marginal Probability</h1>

<ul>
<li>The probability that \(X\) will take the value \(x_i\) regardless of \(Y\) is written as:
$$
P(X = x_i)
$$</li>
<li>\(P(X = x_i)\) is given by the fraction of the total number of points that fall in column \(i\):
$$
P(X = x_{i)}= \frac{c_i}{N}
$$</li>
<li>Obviously we have \(c_{i}= \sum_{j} n_{ij}\) thus:
$$
P(X=x_{i)}= \sum_{j=1}^{L} P(X=x_i,Y=y_j)
$$</li>
<li>This is called the <strong>sum rule</strong></li>
<li>\(P(X=x_i)\) is called marginal probability</li>
</ul>

<h1>Product Rule and Conditional Probability</h1>

<ul>
<li>If we consider only the instances when \(X=x_i\) then the fraction of such instances for which \(Y = y_j\) is written as \(P(Y=y_{j} | X= x_i)\) and it is called the <strong>conditional probability</strong> of \(Y=y_j\)  given \(X = x_i\)
$$
P(Y=y_{j} | X= x_{i)}= \frac{n_{ij}}{c_{i}}
$$</li>
<li>We can then derive:
$$
P(Y=y_{j} , X= x_{i})= \frac{n_{ij}}{c_{i}} = \frac{n_{ij}}{c_{i}} \frac{c_i}{N}=P(Y=y_{j} | X= x_{i})_P(X=x_i)
$$</li>
<li>This is called the <strong>product rule</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1>Bayes' Theorem</h1>

<ul>
<li>Bayes' theorem is a combination of the symmetry property \(P(X,Y) = P(Y,X)\) with conditional properties:
$$
P(Y|X) = \frac{P(X|Y)*P(Y)}{P(X)}
$$
