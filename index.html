        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Master's student specializing in Robotics, with a passion for working in the perception robotics industry. Though in my professional journey I've gained experience in various fields, including software development and SCADA systems.  
        I created this site to showcase my academic work, as well as personal notes and projects and school projects I'm currently working on. Basically just having this website act as my engineering portfolio
